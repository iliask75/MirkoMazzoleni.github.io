I'm a Computer Science Engineer and PhD student at University of Bergamo in the [Control and Automation Laboratory](http://move.unibg.it/cal/). I'm interested in working with problems which involve a strong data-driven component, without losing sight of the engineering part.

This blog is about any data related stuff I come up doing during my work and spare time.
